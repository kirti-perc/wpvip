### Process Product Visibility

One of the tools in this section allows you to process your store's product visibility. If you already have a store full of products, you should run this action to make sure all of your products have the correct visibility settings.

You can also run this action in an attempt to fix any visibility issues.

## Showing Variations

When editing or adding a product variation, you can select whether to show the single variation in the catalog, search results, and filtered results. See the Image below for where these settings are found.

### Show in Search Results?

If a user uses the WooCommerce search field to find a product by name, the variation will be displayed (if it matches the search query).

### Show in Filtered Results?

If a customer uses the product filters in a catalog listing, the variation will be displayed (if it matches the search query).

### Show in Catalog?

The variation will be displayed in normal catalog listings, like the homepage or a category page.

### Featured

When set, this variation will show in "Featured Product" queries, like the featured product shortcode available in WooCommerce.

### Disable "Add to Cart"?

If you want stop people from adding the variation to cart from the catalog pages, check this. It will force the user to click through to add to cart. 

This can be useful if your variation has size and colour attributes, but you're only showing one size of each colour in the catalog results.

### Bulk Settings

Using the bulk options dropdown in the variations tab, you can toggle the following options for all variations:

* **Visibility**  
  * Toggle "Show in Search Results"
  * Toggle "Show in Filtered Results"
  * Toggle "Show in Catalog"
  * Toggle "Featured"
* **Cart**
  * Toggle "Disable 'Add to Cart'"
* **Reporting**
  * Update "Total Sales"  
    Run this if you want to update the total sales of this product, for use when ordering by popularity.
* **Filters**
  * Update "Filter Counts"  
    Sometimes the filter counts in your catalog sidebar are wrong. Run this to update the filter counts based on your variation visibility settings.

## Use a Different Title for the Product Variation

By default, the variation will use the same title as it's parent product. You can change this by entering a new title into the Display Options - Title field. See the Image below for where these settings are found.

## Hide the Main Variable Product

You can do this by default in WooCommerce anyway; simply set the main product visibility, found under Publish > Catalog visibility, to your requirements, and click Update or Publish.
